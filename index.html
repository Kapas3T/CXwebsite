            Did you know? The underscore character (_) is often used in programming and file naming to replace spaces, making it easier to read and manage text without breaking functionality.
            And that CX stands for many things such as : Customer Experience, Creative eXellence, Computer eXperiments and everything with Cyber and eXploration!

        <p>
            It's a versatile abbreviation that can be adapted to various contexts depending on the industry or field, just like me ;p !!

            (Just kidding, this is filler text to make the homepage look a bit more complete while I work on the actual content. Stay tuned for updates!)

            (It's also the keyboard shortcut for (C)copy and (X)cut, wich i use a lot :p)
        </p>
